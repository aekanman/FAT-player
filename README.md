# FAT_player_Altera-Cyclone-II

The purpose of the project is to gain understanding of interfacing with external peripherals (an SD
card and a speaker) via an I2C codec on the Altera Cyclone II evaluation board. Music/audio files are
stored on the SD card and would be read and sent over to the speaker in conjunction with
different play modes specified by the user of the system. The goal of the project is also to gain an
understanding of reading from a FAT file system and parsing the data to properly stream the data
to the speaker.
